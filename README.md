# springboot-graphql-example

Simple API using SpringBoot and GraphQL.

 - Git clone the project for the directory of your choice
 - Then run it with the command:
 
     ./gradlew bootRun
     
     It may be better to use the wrapper cause it will download gradle for you in case you donÂ´t have it yet.
 
 - Access it though the URL: http://localhost:8080/graphiql
 
 First example:
 
  - Query:
  
      query {
        cars {
          id,
          name
        }
      }
      
     . query getting cool cars. This showcase how easy is just to pass a variable that defines a business rule implemented on the backend
     
     query {
        cars {
          id,
          name,
          isCool
        }
      }
      
      . query getting gifs from the cars. With this varible, on the backend you access the API from giphy and then it will return the url 
      regarding the specific car passed
      
           
     query {
        cars {
          name,
          giphyUrl
        }
      }
